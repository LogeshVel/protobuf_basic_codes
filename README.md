Just by cloning this repo won't work for you. And I am sorry for that.  
Becoz there some path dependencies and package dependencies will be there. Some of the proto compiled go files are placed in my default GOPATH and that won't be available here and for the Python the path should be updated. 

So this repo is only for just to get to know working with Protobuf in Go and Python and mainly its for my own reference for my easy recap.
